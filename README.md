# All you need about Neural Network

## some of text and snapshots are related to coursera Machine Learning Course

## some tasks also solved in Octave language
## some of tasks implemented in different libraries and frameworks like Tensorflow and sklearn

### The repo is cosisit of these things:

**Materials**

- Materials in Arabic from my studying to different courses
- English slides for Neural Network that Explain the different aspect of Neural Network
- Examples For more understanding

**Tasks Implemented**
- simple Neural Network with forward propagation
- python code for Binary Classification with Andrew Ng Course
- manual Neural Networks Task from ex3 of week4 Ml By Andrew Ng in python.
	- One Vis All Pure Code
	- One Vis All using Scipy
	- Using Feed Forward NN
- Sklearn Neural Networks Task from ex3 of week4 Ml By Andrew Ng in python.
- Tensorflow Neural Networks Task from ex3 of week4 Ml By Andrew Ng in python.
- Tensorflow clothes Image classifcation


**Different Graphs that help get more intuition**

- Number Representation
- Sigmoid function
- Predict Number after train the model
- slides snapshot
