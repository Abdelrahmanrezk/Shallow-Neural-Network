Machine Learning Course by Stanford University on Coursera.

This a second assignment on week 4
Task is a bout how to apply Multi-class Classification and Neural Networks on data set.
I am using Octave Language to complete this task.


you can find a helpful material & conclusion for week 3 designed by me for Arabic user.

some of screen shots I used from Coursera Materials and Youtube channel by Eng: Hesham Asem.

all tasks solved which are:

Regularized Logisic Regression
One-vs-all classifier training
One-vs-all classifier prediction
Neural Network Prediction Function

also you will see all of task requirements uploaded with file name: ex3.
